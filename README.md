# cleanStay

## Construction Note 🚧 🏗️ 
After a 3 day sprint to generate the rough prototype shown in the video below, I decided to take this project further.
In the meantime, that means I've torn it apart and started over, so this repo isn't in a very demo-able state, but you can expect major updates to the UI, UX, features, and underlying tools.

## Objective
This is a mobile-first app that helps short term rental cleaners and hosts manage tasks, communication, and invoicing. It integrates with booking platform calendars to automatically generate cleaning tasks, and will allow both cleaners and hosts to add customizable maintenance and repair tasks. It will streamline cleaner reporting so that long distance hosts aren't left in the dark about their properties. And longer term, it will also include inventory tracking, cleaner checklists, and other 2nd order features.

## Cleaners first
This app will be a quality of life and productivity tool for both cleaners and hosts... But unlike most other apps out there, when we have to make trade offs, we'll lean toward cleaners first, because the best way to help a host is to help their cleaners.
